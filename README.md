This is an enhanced version of the svg-android project, which supplies Scalable Vector Graphics Support for Android.

This project, a "fork" of the svg-android project, exists to provide additional capabilities to the svg-android project; hopefully the changes and enhancements in this library will be folded in to svg-android someday.
